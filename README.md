# The CHISEI Project
A conceptual AI project coming in the future. Designed to be similar to a personal assistant. I am currently planning for this AI personal
assistant to run on windows PCs and to be built off of the Tensorflow framework. She will be able to interface with your local operating 
system and external API's as well. She will feature NLP, RNN's, LSTM models Deep learning frameworks? etc.
